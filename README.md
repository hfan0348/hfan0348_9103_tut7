> New York, where Mondrian fled after the start of World War II, had a visible impact on his painting. He was inspired to rethink his work in his new context. Broadway Boogie Woogie, one of the last works he completed before his death, omits black and breaks his signature bars of color into multicolored segments. Bouncing against each other, the blocks of color in this painting create a pulsing rhythm, evincing a new dynamism in Mondrian’s work linked to his experience of New York and its jazz scene.(Broadway Boogie Woogie, 2011)
## My Design Work

### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
###### Our group chose Piet Mondrian’s Broadway Boogie Woogie. This work features strong color contrast and uses various sized blocks to divide the canvas. Although it’s static, it implies a strong sense of rhythm, so I wanted to express this hidden rhythm through music. Inspired by XORLAB’s audio visualization, which columns pulsate with sound and emit particles. I plan to animate block sizes with music. Since Broadway is a 2D image, 3D z-axis wouldn’t suit it. So I will apply the x/y-axis scaling from 9103 Week 10 to animate it with the beat.
