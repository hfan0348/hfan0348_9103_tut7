# Final Project: Broadway Boogie Woogie (Piet Mondrian)
![An image of Broadway Boogie Woogie](readmeimages/Piet_Mondrian_Broadway_Boogie_Woogie.jpeg)
> New York, where Mondrian fled after the start of World War II, had a visible impact on his painting. He was inspired to rethink his work in his new context. Broadway Boogie Woogie, one of the last works he completed before his death, omits black and breaks his signature bars of color into multicolored segments. Bouncing against each other, the blocks of color in this painting create a pulsing rhythm, evincing a new dynamism in Mondrianâ€™s work linked to his experience of New York and its jazz scene.
